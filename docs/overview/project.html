  <h1>Project organization</h1>

  <p>Now that we have seen how a Zork game is structured, it&rsquo;s time for us to decide how will we organize our
    project. This entry defines how will we divide our problem space and, therefore, what are we going to build.</p>

  <h2>Project scope</h2>

  <p>Time to ask ourselves the most important question: <em>What do we want to achieve?</em></p>

  <p>A first, very ambiguous answer could be:</p>

  <p class="boxed">I want to allow Interactive Fiction (IF) creators to create games using
    a language as close to ZIL as possible, and to provide players with a way of running the games that have been
    created.</p>

  <p>So we&rsquo;re catering to two different groups of people and in two different moments. Maybe we can rephrase
    the previous answer to be more specific:</p>

  <p class="boxed">I want to create a ZIL-like language for IF creators to create new games, and a game runtime
    engine for players to play games written in said language.</p>

  <h2 id="language">The language</h2>

  <p>I must confess that my first idea was to create a ZIL &ldquo;compiler&rdquo; &mdash;actually, only
    <em>half</em> a parser&mdash; so original ZIL code could be run. But I&rsquo;m sure there are many lexical,
    syntactical, and semantical analyzers out there, and it&rsquo;s been a while since I worked in anything related
    to compilers or interpreters.
  </p>

  <p>So, next best thing would be creating a <em>Domain Specific Language</em> on top of Clojure. Or rather, support
    an existing DSL with Clojure code. Since ZIL has a different syntax than Clojure (for instance, it uses angle
    brackets to define forms), our DSL will be <em>similar</em> to ZIL but not identical.</p>

  <p>The easiest way to go from here is to create a library with Clojure macros and/or functions that do whatever
    ZIL does. This kind of language must:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Help the game creators during the coding phase, when they define the map, the objects, and the object action
      handlers.</li>
    <li>Drive interaction with the <em>game engine</em> during the playing (running) phase.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>In other words, using this language we should be able to create our own <code>dungeon.zil</code> and
    <code>actions.zil</code> files, and the game engine should be able to create the map, objects, and action
    handlers defined in said files.
  </p>

  <h2 id="engine">The game engine</h2>

  <p>While the language will be used to create the game-specific part of the code, the engine should provide the
    functionality the generic files handle in ZIL.</p>

  <p>We don&rsquo;t need to maintain the same separation for the code, and &mdash;which is even more
    important&mdash; we don&rsquo;t have to use our DSL to code the engine. We just need to ensure there&rsquo;s a
    way to:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Read the map, objects, and actions and set up the game so it can be played</li>
    <li>Start the game and initiate the game loop</li>
    <li>Get the player&rsquo;s input, parse it, and respond to it in an appropriate manner</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The second bullet point would be, more or less, the equivalent of <code>gmain.zil</code>. The last one involves
    the rest of the generic <code>.zil</code> files. But, then&hellip; what about the first one?</p>

  <p>Well, since the language is Clojure <em>decorated</em> with a ZIL-line DSL, couldn&rsquo;t we just <em>run</em>
    the
    game-specific files? Of course we can!</p>

  <h2>The whole project</h2>

  <p>This is what we are going to work on: a <strong>single library</strong> that exports <strong>two different
      <em>modules:</em></strong> one to support the <strong>ZIL-like language</strong> &mdash;for the game creators
    to use&mdash;, and the other to act as the <strong>game engine</strong>.</p>

  <p>Game creators will need to write their own Clojure project and include our library as a dependency, so they can
    use ZIcL. They will compile their project as an executable that, using the game engine, will make the game work.</p>

  <p>In our project, we will create example games to show how a game creator would use ZIcL.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Scope</strong></li>
        <ul>
          <li>a ZIL-like language, and</li>

        </ul>

        <li><strong>Language</strong></li>
        <ul>
          <li>a Clojure library for the ZIL-like DSL</li>
          <li>needs to be <em>runnable</em> by the game engine</li>
        </ul>

        <li><strong>Engine</strong></li>
        <ul>
          <li>a Clojure library that works like the Zork generic code</li>
          <li>the game-specific files, created using the DSL, need to interact with it</li>
        </ul>

        <li><strong>Project</strong></li>
        <ul>
          <li>a single library with 2 modules: language & engine</li>
          <li>game creators will write their own Clojure application using the language</li>
          <li>game executable will use both the language and the engine to make the games work</li>
