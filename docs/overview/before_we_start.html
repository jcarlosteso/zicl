      <h1>Before we start</h1>

      <p>Since the goal of this project is porting ZIL into Clojure, having a bit of background about what are we
        working on will probably be useful. Or at least I think it will.</p>

      <p>This entry presents:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>some background about what ZIL is and how did it come to be,</li>
        <li>what makes ZIL work and what are its big blocks,</li>
        <li>why did I chose Clojure as the target language, and</li>
        <li>what do we get out of the box from Clojure, and which gaps will we have to bridge.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>A little bit of history</h2>

      <p>Back in 1977, inspired by the popularity of the 1976&rsquo;s <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossal_Cave_Adventure" target="_blank"
          referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Colossal Cave Adventure</a>&nbsp;game, three students and a research staff member
        at the Dynamic Modelling Group of MIT developed a text-based adventure game called <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zork" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Zork</a>, which was
        eventually expanded and released as three different titles of the Zork Saga.</p>

      <p>Zork&rsquo;s initial implementation was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDL_(programming_language)"
          target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">MDL</a>&nbsp;code running on a DEC <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-10" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">PDP-10</a> mainframe.
      </p>

      <p>In 1979, these three students and five more guys launched <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infocom"
          target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Infocom</a>&nbsp;and started working on two main directions:
        creating more games, and making them available in more platforms.</p>

      <p>To achieve the second goal &mdash;portability&mdash; they created a subset of MDL and made it compilable into
        bytecode that would run in a virtual machine. This way, games would be created once and with no dependencies
        with the underlying hardware &mdash;as long as there was a virtual machine for a particular platform, the game
        would run.</p>

      <p>Thus, ZIL (Zork Implementation Language) was born, and so it was the <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-machine" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Z-machine</a>. As
        stated above, ZIL was a subset of MDL. It had to be compiled and assembled into bytecode <em>(Z-codes)</em>
        understood by the virtual Z-machine, which most of the times was implemented as a Zork Interpreter Program
        (ZIP). Since the Z-machine was single-purpose, the Z-code was optimized enough to be run on a personal computer
        of the eighties.</p>

      <p>So, how did a ZIL game work? Well, it depends on which kind of game we&rsquo;re talking about. Is it pre- or
        post-Infocom? Before the Z-machine, ZIL &mdash;although it didn&rsquo;t actually exist yet&mdash; was more like
        a
        Domain Specific Language running on top of MDL. You could use MDL functions in your code, so ZIL didn&rsquo;t
        have to
        bother implementing those, and at the same time you got your syntactic sugar to help you build your game with
        ease.</p>

      <p>After the birth of Infocom and the creation of ZIL as a language, the compilers and assemblers needed to know
        how to produce bytecode for the MDL subset inherited by the new language, and the Z-machine needed to support
        the execution of every instruction in said subset.</p>

      <h2>Springs and sprockets</h2>

      <p>Ok, we have a 10,000 miles high view of what this project is about. A list of the things we&rsquo;ll need to
        develop &mdash;or procure in any other way&mdash; would be:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>A &ldquo;host&rdquo; language that plays the role MDL does in relation to ZIL,</li>
        <li>a &ldquo;compiler&rdquo; to transform ZIL source code into object bytecode, and</li>
        <li>a virtual machine to interpret the object bytecode and make it run.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>The &ldquo;host&rdquo; language</h3>

      <p>As we have already seen, ZIL was originally built on top of MDL, so we could say MDL was &ldquo;hosting&rdquo;
        it. By that I mean ZIL could leverage all of MDL&rsquo;s functions out-of-the box. In our case, we are going to
        build ZIcL on top of <strong>Clojure</strong>, so it seems we got that covered.</p>

      <p>But, wait! We are in the same situation as when ZIL was going to be ported to other platforms than the PDP-10.
        We will need to support the same MDL subset ZIL-the-language did.</p>

      <p>Does that add any complexity? Not to the coding task. We don&rsquo;t care whether a particular function was
        originally MDL or not; we will need to implement it no matter what. We&rsquo;ll just need an MDL reference guide to
        know <em>what</em> does each of its functions do.</p>

      <h3>The compiler, the bytecode, and the virtual machine</h3>

      <p>This is the easiest part of all. Clojure is a compiled language, so any Clojure compiler will do. The bytecode,
        in this case, would not be Z-code, of course, but <em>Java</em> bytecode, and the virtual machine will be a JVM
        instead of a Z-machine. That&rsquo;s it, then!</p>
