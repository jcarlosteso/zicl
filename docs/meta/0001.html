<h2>Why did I drop the blog</h2>

<p>
  The short version of this entry would be something like: <em>&ldquo;the project had some issues, and I had a lot of issues, and these issues combined
  were just too much.&rdquo;</em>
</p>

<p>
  Oh, you want the <em>long</em> version. Ok. You asked for it.
</p>

<h3>Project issues</h3>

<p>
  The root cause for most of the problems with the project was my <strong>choice of not having planned a narrative.</strong>
</p>

<p>
  Since I wanted to illustrate the impact of design decisions in the how easy &mdash;or how difficult&mdash; it is to implement your features, I decided
  not to think ahead. My only rule was <strong>to have a working product at the end of every post.</strong>
</p>

<p>
  This two choices resulted in more trouble than I anticipated. I started every post with no knowledge of what would imply working in my next
  &ldquo;iteration&rdquo;, and that usually meant hours spent reading specification documents and digging into a version of the source code that didn't
  match the one from the docs.
</p>

<p>
  Eventually, I ended up working a buffer of future posts to be published on a schedule, so that I had time to look ahead and make any changes I needed
  in the posts and code so that future extensions didn't involve a lot of rewriting.
</p>

<h3>Personal issues</h3>

<p>
  These issues all boil down to just one thing: my 
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
    <strong>major depressive disorder</strong>
  </a>
  &mdash;maybe depression with anxious distress, but I'm no psychiatrist. For those so fortunate that have no idea what that implies, let me just say
  it's beyond feeling <em>sad.</em> It's also the inability of finding motivation, energy, focus, interest, or joy in any usually enjoyable activity.
  <em>And</em> feeling guilty for feeling like that.
</p>

<p>
  In my case, I have <strong>bursts of mania that result in feverish activity</strong> on a particular subject, quickly followed by a complete loss of
  interest on whatever I was doing, finding it &mdash;<em>and</em> me&mdash; suddenly useless. It's happened to me many times and, even being aware of
  my condition, and having been warned  of its implications time and again by my psychologist, I still can't help falling into that slippery slope.
</p>

<p>
  Strictly speaking about the blog, there was an extra reason. I was right in the middle of a decision making process about whether to keep working as a
  freelancer or join a company and, since there was no option without a downside &mdash;yeah, as if&hellip;&mdash; I was under <strong>heavy
  stress.</strong>
</p>

<p>
  On top of all this, pile the fact that <strong>having a publishing schedule meant additional pressure,</strong> that <strong>having no clear idea of
  how to continue</strong> from where I stood at the end of my buffer <strong>was giving me anxiety,</strong> and that <strong>I started feeling like I
  wasn't capable of doing it,</strong> and you've got the whole picture.
