  <h1>The language</h1>

  <p>Since one of our goals is to develop a DSL &ldquo;emulating&rdquo; ZIL, this entry presents the language we
    want to support. We will analyze real code from Zork I and explain what does everything mean, including some
    implementation details, <em>if</em> they add context.</p>

  <p>Some initial decisions about how to shape our DSL will be made, but not yet about its implementation, though.
    That will be dealt with when we analyze the game engine.</p>

  <h2>The basics</h2>

  <p>I assume you are familiar with Clojure, or at least any LISP dialect. If that&rsquo;s not your case, you can
    find some background about the Wonderful World of the Many Parentheses <a href="../basics/lisp.html">here</a>.</p>
