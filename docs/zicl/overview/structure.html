  <h1>Zork code structure</h1>

  <p>The original Zork &mdash;written in MDL and ran on a PDP-10&mdash; was a single game, but that was too big for
    personal computers, so it had to be split into three titles.</p>

  <p>Each of the three titles Zork was split into had 10 <code>.zil</code> files that can be grouped in:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A <em>loader</em> file, typically named <code>zork<em>&lt;n&gt;</em>.zil</code></li>
    <li>Seven <em>generic code</em> files, named as <code>g<em>&lt;module&gt;</em>.zil</code></li>
    <li>Two <em>specific code</em> files, named as <code><em>&lt;n&gt;&lt;module&gt;</em>.zil</code></li>
  </ul>

  <p>where <code><em>n</em></code> is the number of the title, and <code><em>module</em></code> is the role the code
    of a particular file plays in the game.</p>

  <p>Let see what each of these <code>.zil</code> files was for.</p>

  <h2>The loader</h2>

  <p>This file has two tasks: set a default value for some <em>properties</em> and load the rest of the
    <code>.zil</code> files. It doesn&rsquo;t start the game, though; for that, we need to run the
    <code>GO</code> routine, included in a different file.
  </p>

  <h2>The generic files</h2>

  <p>These seven files are carried from one Zork instalment to the next, with little changes, if any.</p>

  <h3>gmain.zil</h3>

  <p>This file does not change from one instalment of Zork to the next. It contains:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The main game loop,</li>
    <li>the <code>PERFORM</code> routine, which executes a valid action requested by the player,</li>
    <li>several <code>CONSTANT</code>s and a couple <code>GLOBAL</code> objects, and</li>
    <li>a function and a <code>ROUTINE</code> that appear to be used only for debugging.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Apparently, here is where <code>GO</code> was defined, too, because there&rsquo;s a comment indicating it was
    moved to the <code>special.zil</code> file. There's no such file, though, and <code>GO</code> actually is in the
    game-specific actions file, along with a comment that instructs programmers to keep it there &mdash;but
    doesn&rsquo;t say why.</p>

  <h3>gparser.zil</h3>

  <p>As its name indicates, this file contains all the logic related to parsing the player&rsquo;s input, including
    syntax checking.</p>

  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Blank" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Marc Blank</a>
    said called the parser <em>&ldquo;the most incomprehensible piece of code&rdquo;</em> in their system, but its
    function is quite simple: take the player&rsquo;s input, process it, and return up to three things: an action
    &mdash;also called a <em>verb</em>&mdash;, a direct object, and an indirect object. Or, if the input is not
    valid, a message indicating that situation.</p>

  <p>There&rsquo;s a lot going on in this file, to be honest. Like <em>guessing</em> which object an action could be
    applied to, if the player didn&rsquo;t indicate it. Or, in the previous case, asking the player which object
    they&rsquo;s referring to, if it cannot be guessed. Or which object is going to actually handle the action
    &mdash;we&rsquo;ll see more about this, eventually.</p>

  <p>Zork 2 introduced some changes to this file, but they were later commented out.</p>

  <h3>gsyntax.zil</h3>

  <p>As mentioned above, part of the parser&rsquo;s job is to validate the player&rsquo;s input against the allowed
    syntaxes; these syntaxes are defined in this file.</p>

  <p>Every <code>SYNTAX</code> definition includes what the player&rsquo;s input looks like, and which action
    &mdash;and, optionally, which <em>pre-action</em>&mdash; should be executed as a result.</p>

  <p>Like with the previous file, Zork 2 introduced several changes in this one, but they were later commented out.
  </p>

  <h3>gverbs.zil</h3>

  <p>Every player action, or <em>verb</em>, requires a <code>ROUTINE</code> to be executed. This is the file where
    all of these actions are defined. It also contains <em>pre-actions</em>, which are <code>ROUTINE</code>s that
    are run <em>before</em> the action takes place, for instance, to check if the action is even possible given the
    current game status.</p>

  <p>Note that <em>object action handlers</em> are not defined here, but on a game-specific file.</p>

  <p>Apparently, Zork 2 introduced a change in one of the pre-actions, but the code I have for Zork 1 has been
    already updated. The only proof of the existence of an old version for that <code>ROUTINE</code> is its
    commented-out code in Zork 2&rsquo;s repository. Other changes were also made, but later commented out.</p>

  <h3>gglobals.zil</h3>

  <p>Games may have objects that can be referenced from everywhere. The ground, for example. Or the player. Or
    <em>parts</em> of the player&rsquo;s body, like their hands. This file is where all these objects are defined. They
    are
    called <em>global</em> because of them being accessible everywhere in the game.
  </p>

  <p>Not all objects defined in this file are relevant to the gameplay. Some of them act as containers for game
    specific contents, like <code>ROOMS</code> &mdash;a container for all rooms defined in the game&rsquo;s
    dungeon&mdash;, <code>GLOBAL-OBJECTS</code> &mdash;a container for every object that can always be
    accessed&mdash;, or <code>LOCAL-GLOBALS</code> &mdash;a container for all objects accessible from more than one
    room.</p>

  <h3>gmacros.zil</h3>

  <p>One of the most important features of LIST and its dialects is their <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoiconicity" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">homoiconicity</a>,
    the notion behind the <em>&ldquo;code is data&rdquo;</em> half
    of the motto. The fact that LIST dialects &mdash;one of which is MDL, and therefore ZIL, as it&rsquo;s an MDL
    subset&mdash; allow handling code as if it was data gives these languages the capability of defining
    <em>macros</em>: functions that are run <em>at compile time</em> to generate&hellip; more functions. Or data
    structures, whatever we need.
  </p>

  <p>A typical use case for macros is defining a Domain-Specific Language, DSL for short. DSLs are great when you
    want to use in your code constructs that belong to the problem space, making the code more readable. Other
    frequent use of macros is avoiding code repetition.</p>

  <p>Since macros produce new code when they are run, it is said they <em>expand</em>: at compile time, the macro
    call will be replaced by the macro code, using any arguments they may receive, as if we were doing smart
    copy&paste. More often than not, the resulting code is longer than the macro call, hence the <em>macro
      expansion</em> expression.</p>

  <p>Every macro the game creators defined are in this file. This is another example of file that changed on Zork 2,
    but the only added function was later commented out.</p>

  <h3>gclock.zil</h3>

  <p>This file deals with <em>queued events</em>, events triggered by some in-game action but that take place in the
    future.</p>

  <p>The exposed API is quite simple: a <code>QUEUE</code> routine to enqueue actions, an <code>INT</code> routine
    to get a queued event so we can <code>DISABLE</code> or <code>ENABLE</code> it, and a <code>CLOCKER</code>
    routine to keep track of the remaining turns for a queued event to be fired, and triggering events when the time
    has come.</p>

  <p>This file didn't change from one instalment of Zork to the next.</p>

  <h2>The specific files</h2>

  <p>Only two files per title are game-specific:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><code><em>&lt;n&gt;</em>dungeon.zil</code> contains all <code>ROOM</code>s and <code>OBJECT</code>s for the
      game,
      and</li>
    <li><code><em>&lt;n&gt;</em>actions.zil</code> contains the <code>ROUTINE</code>s for the objects&rsquo; actions
      &mdash;we will learn more about this later.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><code><em>n</em></code> refers to the game number &mdash;for example, Zork 1 files are
    <code>1dungeon.zil</code> and <code>1actions.zil</code>.
