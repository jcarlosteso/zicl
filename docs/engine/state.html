  <h1>The game engine</h1>

  <p>As we discussed while talking about <a href="/zicl/overview/project.html/#engine">Project structure</a>, one of
    the pieces we need to provide is the game engine &mdash;the piece of software that sets the game up, waits for
    player input and reacts to it by executing the requested action or giving the player feedback about why it
    couldn&rsquo;t
    be done.</p>

  <h2>Game state</h2>

  <p>As every other game, Interactive Fiction is all about game state. Game designers will use ZIcL to create the
    initial game state. Players will interact with the game and, as a result, the game state may change. So, apparently,
    we have to deal with <em>mutable</em> state, right?
  </p>

  <p>That is precisely ZIL&rsquo;s approach. For example, in Zork I there&rsquo;s a rug in the Living Room that can be
    moved. Its initial state is defined in the <code>1actions.zil</code> file, like this:</p>

  <pre>&lt;<code>GLOBAL</code> RUG-MOVED <code>&lt;&gt;</code>&gt;</pre>

  <p>where <code>&lt;&gt;</code> is an <em>empty list</em>, which serves as a boolean <em>false</em>. If, while in the
    Living Room, the player enters something along the lines of <code>MOVE RUG</code>, the subsequent action should do
    something like this:</p>

  <pre><code>&lt;SETG</code> RUG-MOVED <code>T&gt;</code></pre>

  <p>where <code>T</code> is the boolean <em>true</em>.</p>

  <p>If we wanted to get the current value of <code>RUG-MOVED</code>, we need to do something like this:</p>

  <pre>&lt;<code>COND (</code>,RUG-MOVED</pre>

  <p>where <code>,RUG-MOVED</code> means <em>&ldquo;get the current value of the global atom
    <code>RUG-MOVED</code>.&rdquo;</em> Using the comma means the referred atom is global, and the expression is
    shorthand for <code>&lt;GVAL RUG-MOVED&gt;</code>. This is because it is <em>legal</em> to define a local
    variable with the same name of a global one; you just need to prefix the variable name with a comma when
    referring to the global one, and with a dot (<code>.</code>) when referring to the local one.</p>

  <h2>Initial state</h2>

  <p>The initial state of the game is also defined by the rooms and objects that the game designer created. ZIL uses
    structured data to model these. Both rooms and objects have properties, as if they were objects in the OOP sense,
    but they do not have methods. Instead, some of their properties contain a reference to a <code>ROUTINE</code>
    that will be executed under certain conditions.</p>

  <p>In the file <code>gglobals.zil</code> you can find the following code:</p>

  <pre>&lt;<code>OBJECT</code> GLOBAL-OBJECTS
  <code>(FLAGS</code> RMUNGBIT INVISIBLE TOUCHBIT SURFACEBIT TRYTAKEBIT
         OPENBIT SEARCHBIT TRANSBIT ONBIT RLANDBIT FIGHTBIT
         STAGGERED WEARBIT<code>)</code>&gt;
        
&lt;<code>OBJECT</code> LOCAL-GLOBALS
  <code>(IN</code> GLOBAL-OBJECTS<code>)</code>
  <code>(SYNONYM</code> ZZMGCK<code>)</code>
  <code>(DESCFCN</code> PATH-OBJECT<code>)</code>
  <code>(GLOBAL</code> GLOBAL-OBJECTS<code>)</code>
  <code>(ADVFCN</code> 0)
  <code>(FDESC</code> <code class="string">"F"</code><code>)</code>
  <code>(LDESC</code> <code class="string">"F"</code><code>)</code>
  <code>(PSEUDO</code> <code class="string">"FOOBAR"</code> V-WALK<code>)</code>
  <code>(CONTFCN</code> 0<code>)</code>
  <code>(VTYPE</code> 1<code>)</code>
  <code>(SIZE</code> 0<code>)</code>
  <code>(CAPACITY</code> 0<code>)</code>&gt;

&lt;<code>OBJECT</code> ROOMS
  <code>(IN</code> TO ROOMS<code>)</code>&gt;</pre>

  <p>There&rsquo;s a couple things to highlight in the previous code:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>ZIL is ambiguous when using <code>OBJECT</code>. It can refer to an in-game thing, or to a data structure. These
      examples are of the second kind.</li>
    <li>We can define global objects, and&hellip; <em>local</em> globals?</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Referencing objects</h3>

  <p>When talking about in-game objects, they usually are found on a room, or in the player&rsquo;s inventory if they
    have been taken. That&rsquo;s what the <code>IN</code> &mdash;or <code>LOC</code>, in older versions of ZIL&mdash; property is
    for: to indicate in which room the object can be found. The above code sample uses <code>IN</code>, though, to indicate that
    <code>LOCAL-GLOBALS</code> is &ldquo;inside&rdquo; <code>GLOBAL-OBJECTS</code>. What does that mean?
  </p>

  <p><code>GLOBAL-OBJECTS</code> is a container for every object that can be referenced from anywere in the game. The
    sky, for example. Or the ground. Or the player, and parts of the player&rsquo;s body. But what are
    <code>LOCAL-GLOBALS</code>? These are the objects that can be referenced from more than one room. A door connecting
    two rooms, for example. Or a staircase. A better name for <code>LOCAL-GLOBALS</code> would have been
    <code>SHARED-OBJECTS</code>, in my opinion.</p>

  <p><code>ROOM</code> structures have a <code>GLOBAL</code> property to indicate what objects is the room sharing.</p>

  <h2>Possible approaches</h2>

  <p>We have seen that ZIL uses mutable state, and different <em>stores</em> for different pieces of the state. Rooms
    and objects are their
    own structures. Other state values are stored in their individual atoms. We could just <em>port</em> that code to
    Clojure, since it is
    also a Lisp and, therefore, allows creating mutable <em>variables.</em></p>

  <p>Keeping the bare basics of the previous code sample, we could do something like this:</p>

  <pre>(<code>def</code> global-objects <code>(</code>atom <code class="string">{}</code><code>)</code>)

(<code>def</code> shared-objects <code>(</code>atom <code class="string">{}</code><code>)</code>)

(<code>def</code> rooms <code>(</code>atom <code class="string">{}</code><code>)</code>)</pre>

  <p>There, we just created three <em>vars</em> (renaming <code>LOCAL-GLOBALS</code> as <code>shared-objects</code>) and
    initialized them with
    a Clojure <code>atom</code>, each containing an empty hashmap. Similarly, we could model the <code>RUG-MOVED</code>
    flag like this:</p>

  <pre>(<code>def</code> rug-moved? <code>(</code>atom <code>false)</code>)</pre>

  <p>Getting the value for any of these vars would be as simple as using <code>deref</code>, or the shorter form:
    <code>@rug-moved?</code>,
    for instance, would return the current value of the atom bound to the <code>rug-moved?</code> symbol. If we wanted
    to change its value,
    we would have to use something like <code>(reset! rug-moved? true)</code>.
  </p>

  <p>The reason why I preferred initializing the first three atoms with an empty hashmap is because I think that would
    be the preferred way of
    storing collections of items, so we can access them via a key. For instance, if we had this definition:</p>

  <pre>&lt;<code>OBJECT</code> HANDS
  <code>(IN</code> GLOBAL-OBJECTS<code>)</code>
  <code>(DESC</code><code class="string"> "pair of hands"</code><code>)</code>&gt;</pre>

  <p>we could model it so it resulted in <code>global-objects</code> containing something like
    <code>{ :hands { :desc "pair of hands" } }</code>.
    We could, then, refer to the object using <code>(:hands @global-objects)</code>.
  </p>

  <h3>A single store</h3>

  <p>Another approach could be having <em>all</em> of the game state bound to a single symbol. For example, something
    like this:</p>

  <pre>(<code>def</code> game-state
  <code>(</code>atom
   <code class="string">{</code>:<code>rooms</code> <code class="string">{}</code>
    :<code>objects</code> <code class="string">{</code>:<code>global {}</code>
              :<code>shared {}</code><code class="string">}</code>
    :<code>variables</code> <code class="string">{}}</code><code>)</code>)</pre>

  <p>This approach would make very simple to save/load the game, because it has all of the information needed already
    &ldquo;serialized&rdquo;
    in a single structure that we could store as a <code>.edn</code> file.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, adding rooms, objects, or variables would be a little more complicated. For example, if we
    wanted to create the previous
    RUG-MOVED flag, we would need to do something like this:</p>

  <pre>(swap! game-state assoc-in <code>[</code>:<code>variables</code> :<code>rug-moved?] false</code>)</pre>

  <p>That would also be the way we update values. For us to get the current value, we would have to do something like
    <code></code>
  </p>

  <pre>(get-in @game-state <code>[</code>:<code>variables</code> :<code>rug-moved?]</code>)</pre>

  <p>We probably should create some helper functions for this, if we decide to adopt this approach.</p>

  <h3>Going purely functional</h3>

  <p>A single store might allow us to use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Store-passing_style" target="_blank"
      referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
      Store-passing style</a> technique. With this approach, we would need to structure our game code like this:</p>

  <pre>(<code>defn</code> start <code>[]</code>
  <code>(loop</code> <code class="string">[</code>state <code class="string">(</code>initial-state<code class="string">)]
    (</code><code>let</code> <code class="string">[</code>command <code>(</code>get-player-input<code>)</code><code class="string">]
      (</code><code>if (</code>= <code class="string">"QUIT"</code> command<code>)
        (</code>println <code class="string">"Bye!"</code><code>)
        (recur</code> <code class="string">(</code>next-state state command<code class="string">)</code><code>)</code><code class="string">))</code><code>)</code>)</pre>

  <p>Of course, the above is almost pseudocode, but it shows how the final code could look like. We would obviously need
    to define the <code>initial-state, get-player-input, </code>and <code>next-state</code> functions. The first one
    should gather all of the room and object definitions and all of the variables and build a single store with all the
    initial game state. The second one should retrieve the player&rsquo;s input from the console. The final one should
    generate a new game state based on the current state and the entered command.</p>

  <p>The main problem of this approach would be creating the initial state in a functional way as pure as we can. Off
    the top of my
    head, making this approach work would require the DSL to do something like this:</p>

  <pre>(<code>defn</code> ROOM <code>[</code>room-name description<code>]
    (-&gt;</code> <code class="string">(</code>create-ns 'zicl.temp.rooms<code class="string">)
        (</code>intern <code class="string">(</code>symbol room-name<code class="string">)
                {</code>:<code>key (</code>keyword room-name<code>)</code>
                 :<code>desc</code> description<code class="string">})
        (</code>alter-meta! assoc :<code>object</code> :<code>room</code><code class="string">)</code><code>)</code>)</pre>

  <p>The above code creates a temporary namespace where we will intern all of the rooms the game designer creates using
    our DSL. It also
    attaches metadata to the created var so we can identify it as a room; this would guarantee that, if we add anything
    else to the same
    namespace in the future, we will be able to filter public vars to get only the ones that are rooms.</p>

  <p>Our <code>initial-state</code> function would need to get the <code>ns-publics</code> for each of the temporary
    namespaces we might have
    created, filter them to get the appropriate kind of var based on its metadata, and build the state hashmap. We could
    also remove the temporary
    namespaces, since we won&rsquo;t use them any more.</p>
