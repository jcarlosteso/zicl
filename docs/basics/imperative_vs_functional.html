      <h1>Imperative vs. Functional</h1>

      <p>While Fortran uses <em>instructions,</em> LISP uses <em>expressions.</em> In other words,
        imperative languages help programmers define <em>how</em> a certain task must be performed, while functional
        languages help them define <em>what</em> a particular concept is.
      </p>

      <p>Let&rsquo;s see how this is different using Javascript, because it can be used either way, and also because
        it&rsquo;s almost ubiquitous. We will create a simple script that multiplies every even number in a vector by
        10, calculates the sum of all multiplications, and displays the sum in console:</p>

      <div class="code-comparison">
        <strong>Imperative</strong>
        <strong>Functional</strong>
        <pre>
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];

let result = 0;

for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
  if (numbers[i] % 2 === 0) {
    result += numbers[i] * 10;
  }
}

console.log(result);
        </pre>
        <pre>
console.log(
  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
    .filter(number => number % 2 === 0)
    .map(number => number * 10)
    .reduce((sum, number) => sum + number, 0)
);
        </pre>
      </div>

      <p>The code in the left side could be read as: <em>&ldquo;Take this list of numbers and store it in a box labelled
          as <code>numbers.</code> Then, in a different box labelled <code>result,</code> store a zero. Now,
          take the first number in the list you stored in the <code>numbers</code> box, and, if and only if it&rsquo;s
          even, take whatever value we have stored in the <code>result</code> box, add to it the number you have taken
          multiplied by 10, and store the total again into the <code>result</code> box, and get the next number, if any.
          You have to do this until you run out of numbers in the list. When you&rsquo;re done, write the contents of
          the <code>result</code> box down.&rdquo;</em></p>

      <p>Throw a bunch of swearwords on that and you could easily hear it in Tom Highway&rsquo;s voice &mdash;meaning in
        Clint Eastwood&rsquo;s voice, of course. On the other hand, the left side code could be read as: <em>&ldquo;The
          number we will write is the result of taking only even numbers in this list, multiplying them all by 10, and
          adding the result of the multiplications.&rdquo;</em></p>

      <p>Both &ldquo;transcriptions&rdquo; may seem almost identical, but that&rsquo;s because I am simplifying the
        first
        one. A more accurate version would include explaining <em>how</em> do we take the first number in the list,
        <em>how</em> do we take the next number in the list, and <em>how</em> do we know we are run out of numbers. It
        would also need to detail <em>how</em> do we know if a number is odd or even.
      </p>

      <p>Also, both of them are just two different flavors of code written in an imperative language with some
        functional toppings, and that doesn&rsquo;t help perceiving the difference. The next entry will shed some
        light on that, hopefully.</p>
