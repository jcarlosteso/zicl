  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>In January 2023, I started a blog about porting <a href="https://www.ifwiki.org/ZIL" target="_blank"
      referrerpolicy="no-referrer">ZIL</a> to <a href="https://clojure.org/" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
      Clojure</a>. It&rsquo;s something I decided to do because it ties two of my favorite things: interactive fiction,
      and coding &mdash;what&rsquo;s more, coding in <em>Clojure</em>.</p>

  <p>My initial intention for the blog was to capture every design decision in it, to make it more about the <em>why</em>
      than about the <em>how</em>. That didn&rsquo;t last long, however. It became more of a <em>step-by-step guide to ZIcL
      (Zork Implementation</em> Clojure <em>Language)</em>.</p>

  <p>Eventually, like I do with almost all of my personal projects &mdash;I mean, those who I <em>actually</em> start&mdash;,
    I abandoned the idea. There were <a href="misc/why_did_i_drop_the_blog.html">several reasons</a> for me to drop it. Some
    of them even were <em>real</em> reasons. But the fact is, I cut the blog short, and I regret that.</p>

  <p>So I&rsquo;m going to try and reboot this. Not as a blog, but as an ongoing document which I&rsquo;ll keep on Github
    along with my code. There is a <a href="misc/why_did_i_chose_this_format.html">reasoning</a> behind that change of format,
    too, but for now I&rsquo;ll just say I try to address some of the things that made me drop the previous iteration of this
    project.</p>
