      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>In January 2023, I started a blog about porting <a href="https://www.ifwiki.org/ZIL" target="_blank"
          referrerpolicy="no-referrer">ZIL</a> to
        <a href="https://clojure.org/" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Clojure</a>. It&rsquo;s something I decided to
        do because it ties two of my
        favorite things: interactive fiction, and coding &mdash;what&rsquo;s more, coding in <em>Clojure</em>.</p>
    
      <p>
        My initial intention for the blog was to capture every design decision in it, to make it more about the <em>why</em>
        than about the <em>how</em>.
        That didn&rsquo;t last long, however. It became more of a <em>step-by-step guide to ZIcL (Zork Implementation</em> Clojure
        <em>Language)</em>.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        Eventually, like I do with almost all of my personal projects &mdash;I mean, those who I <em>actually</em> start&mdash;, I
        abandoned the idea. There were
        <a href="misc/why_did_i_drop_the_blog.html">several reasons</a> for me to drop it. Some of them even were <em>real</em> reasons. But
        the fact is, I cut the blog short,
        and I regret that.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        So I&rsquo;m going to try and reboot this. Not as a blog, but as an ongoing document which I&rsquo;ll keep on Github along with
        my code. There is a
        <a href="misc/why_did_i_chose_this_format.html">reasoning</a> behind that change of format, too, but for now I&rsquo;ll just say I try to address
        some of the things that made me
        drop the previous iteration of this project.
