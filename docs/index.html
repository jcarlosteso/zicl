  <h1>The adven<em>j</em>urer reloaded</h1>

  <p>
    In January 2023, I started a blog about porting <a href="https://www.ifwiki.org/ZIL" target="_blank"
      referrerpolicy="no-referrer">ZIL</a> to
    <a href="https://clojure.org/" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Clojure</a>. It's something I decided to
    do because it ties two of my
    favorite things: interactive fiction, and coding &mdash;what's more, coding in <em>Clojure</em>.
  </p>

  <p>
    My initial intention for the blog was to capture every design decision in it, to make it more about the <em>why</em>
    than about the <em>how</em>.
    That didn't last long, however. It became more of a <em>step-by-step guide to ZICL (Zork Implementation</em> Clojure
    <em>Language)</em>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Eventually, like I do with almost all of my personal projects &mdash;I mean, those who I actually start,&mdash; I
    abandoned the idea. There were
    <a href="meta/0001.html">several reasons</a> for me to drop it. Some of them even were <em>real</em> reasons. But
    the fact is, I cut the blog short,
    and I regret that.
  </p>

  <p>
    So I'm going to try and reboot this. Not as a blog, but as an ongoing document which I'll keep on Github along with
    my code. There is a
    <a href="meta/0002.html">reasoning</a> behind that change of format, too, but for now I'll just say I try to address
    some of the things that made me
    drop the previous iteration of this project.
