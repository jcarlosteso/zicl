      <h1>Stateful vs. Stateless</h1>

      <p>One of the key features of the Functional Programming paradigm is called <em>immutability,</em> and means
        exactly what it says. Ok, I&rsquo;ll elaborate on that, by introducing the concept of <em>state</em>.
      </p>

      <h2>What is state</h2>

      <p>State is what we answer when someone asks us questions like <em>&ldquo;How are you?&rdquo;</em> or
        <em>&ldquo;How are you feeling?&rdquo;</em> These questions want a snapshot as an answer. State is an isolated
        frame from a movie. Like when the smart detective freezes the CCTV image she&rsquo;s been watching all night,
        points her finger to the screen, and says <em>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s him. That&rsquo;s our man.&rdquo;</em>
      </p>

      <p>Imperative languages &mdash;including Object-Oriented&mdash; are all about checking or changing state. And
        that&rsquo;s ok, that&rsquo;s how it should be, right? <em>Everything</em> can be thought of as either a
        checklist or a to-do list. State is what the checklist handles. Changing state is going through the steps of the
        appropriate to-do list for the expected outcome.</p>

      <p>Let see an example. You want a coffee, so you open your moka pot to check if there&rsquo;s enough
        coffee in it for another cup. You&rsquo;re lucky, there&rsquo;s just enough
        for you, so you go grab your mug, come back to the moka pot and pour all of the remaining coffee into it. You
        drink your nice cup of coffee and feel great. All is well that ends well, right?
      </p>

      <p><em>Wrong.</em></p>

      <h2>Jerky McJerkface</h2>

      <p><em>&ldquo;How could it be wrong?&rdquo;,</em> you may be wondering. Well, because, while you were gone to get
        your favorite coffee mug, that stupid guy from Accounting checked the moka pot, saw there was enough coffee for
        a cup, poured it into the mug <em>he was carrying with him</em> and went away while sipping <em>your</em>
        coffee. Yeah, what an absolute jerk.</p>

      <p>This here is a problem of <em>concurrency.</em> Several people have access to the only moka pot, and all of
        them may change its state. The problem with the prior example is that the <em>hypothetical you</em> checked the
        pot <em>before</em> grabbing a mug, and comes back thinking everything is as it was last time <em>you</em>
        checked. The Accounting guy may be a jerk, but he was wise enough to <em>first</em> grab a mug, and
        <em>then</em> check the pot.
      </p>

      <p>Concurrency has been giving headaches to language creators and coders for decades, and many Imperative
        languages have found a more or less convoluted way to handle it. Functional languages &mdash;or rather
        <em>pure</em> Functional languages&mdash; simply avoid it by being <em>stateless.</em>
      </p>

      <h3>Stateful</h3>

      <p>A <em>stateful</em> language allows creating &ldquo;storage boxes&rdquo; whose content may be altered.
        That&rsquo;s why these &ldquo;boxes&rdquo; are called <em>variables.</em> Imperative languages, even the
        Object-Oriented ones, draw a hard line between stuff we work with &mdash;the data&mdash; and the things we can
        do with that stuff &mdash;the instructions. We instruct the computer to follow a step-by-step procedure as if we
        were playing and Interactive Fiction game. For instance:</p>

      <pre class="console">
You are in the KITCHEN.
There is a MOKA POT on the STOVE.
There is a TRASH BIN.
You are carrying NOTHING.

> Take the moka pot.
You are in the KITCHEN.
There is a TRASH BIN.
You are carrying:
  - 1 MOKA POT.

> Unscrew it.
You are in the KITCHEN.
There is a TRASH BIN.
You are carrying:
  - 1 KETTLE
  - 1 BOILER

...
      </pre>

      <p>There are several things in the previous example that has state. Players know where they are and what are they
        carrying. Rooms may have stuff in them. Some objects can contain others, others can be opened or closed&hellip;
        The player&rsquo;s instructions may change these states: <code>Take the moka pot</code>, for example, changes
        both the player&rsquo;s and the room&rsquo;s inventories.</p>

      <p>A <code>Move</code> instruction would only need a <code>direction</code> argument, because the player&rsquo;s
        current location is stored in the state. If it&rsquo;s a valid direction, the instruction would alter the state
        by updating the player&rsquo;s location.</p>

      <h3>Stateless</h3>

      <p>A Functional language, however, won&rsquo;t have state. We won&rsquo;t have <em>variables</em> to store the
        current value of, for example, the player&rsquo;s location. This means a <code>Move</code> instruction requires
        <em>two</em> arguments: the current location, and the direction the player is moving to. And it would
        <em>always</em> return the results, no matter if the move was a legal one or not.
      </p>

      <h4><em>Pure</em> vs <em>impure</em> functions</h4>

      <p>Functions that rely exclusively on their arguments to do their job and never produce any output except for
        their result are called <em>pure</em> functions. Another definition for pure functions is that they
        <em>always</em> provide the same output when given the same input. That could not happen if said function relied
        on external state to do its job.
      </p>


      <p>Any function that relies in or causes a <em>side effect</em> is an <em>impure</em> function. Side effects
        include things so basic as writing messages in the console, storing data into a file or a database, or request
        the user&rsquo;s input. Exceptions are another kind of side effect, since they produce an output but not as the
        return value of the function.</p>

      <p>While in theory we could build a complete application only using pure functions, most of them will need to make
        use of certain side effects to be useful. In that case, there should be a clear and hard line drawn between the
        core functionality &mdash;which should be built with pure functions so it&rsquo;s more easily testable&mdash;,
        and the I/O &mdash;which <em>needs</em> to be impure.</p>

      <h2>Functional <em>and</em> stateful?</h2>

      <p>Could we write an application using a Functional language and make it have state? It depends on the language,
        but chances are you can. Common Lisp, for example, has <code>DEFVAR</code>, which creates a <em>variable</em>
        whose value can be modified by using <code>SETF</code>. Clojure provides different flavors of
        &ldquo;variables&rdquo; which address different kinds of necessities.</p>

      <p>The real questions here is, <em>should</em> you?</p>
