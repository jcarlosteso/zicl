      <h1>What is LISP?</h1>

      <p>If I just said LISP is a programming language, most of you would figuratively walk away from this site, never
        to look back. But, yes, at its heart of hearts, LISP is yet another way humans have found to represent
        algorithms.</p>

      <p>And it&rsquo;s one of the first programming languages, too. The second, after Fortran. And, like Fortran, it
        was conceived as a way to represent mathematical expressions.</p>

      <p>But LISP is nothing like Fortran. While the latter is an <em>imperative</em> language, the former is a
        <em>functional</em> one. In the following entries, we will see what does that exactly mean.
      </p>




      <p>The basic element of every LISP dialect is called the <em>form</em>, which actually means <em>&ldquo;anything
          that can be evaluated.&rdquo;</em> There&rsquo;s only two types of forms: <em>atoms,</em> and <em>cons.</em>
      </p>

      <p><strong>Atoms</strong> are simple values. They can be <em>self-evaluated</em> &mdash;like <code>1</code>,
        which is a simple number without a particular <em>name</em> attached to it&mdash; or <em>symbols</em>
        &mdash;which refer indirectly to a value.</p>

      <p><strong>Cons,</strong> on the other hand, are <em>pairs of things</em>. The first of these things (called the
        <em>CAR</em>) is always an atom. The second (called the <em>CDR</em>) can be an atom, too, but it can
        also be a <em>reference</em> to a next cons.
      </p>

      <p>A <strong>list,</strong> then, is nothing more than a chain of cons. A list properly built will have a
        <code>nil</code> &mdash;or an empty list&mdash; as its CDR.
      </p>
