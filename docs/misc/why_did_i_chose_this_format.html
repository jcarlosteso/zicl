      <h1>Why did I choose this format</h1>

      <p>Since the first iteration didn't pan out, I wanted to try something different for this one. Instead of
        wandering around the features of ZIL looking for the next best thing to include into my project and, once I
        chose one, start digging into it and coding it in Clojure, this time <strong>I'd like to take a more organized,
          top-down approach.</strong></p>

      <p>This will imply:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Starting with an overview of the <em>modules</em> ZIL is composed of, what does every one of them do, and how do they interact. Also, making the first design choices and writing some code as a sort of scaffolding for the rest of the project.</li>
        <li>Defining an initial <em>roadmap</em> for the project, taking only into account the &ldquo;big blocks&rdquo;.</li>
        <li>Following the roadmap to analyze, split if necessary, and design features. Adjust the roadmap if needed.</li>
        <li>Repeat the previous step until the project is done.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Ok, but… why <em>this</em> format?</h2>

      <p>Oh, right. Right. Well, because <strong>I have no idea how long will each feature take to be built.</strong></p>
      
      <p>Switching from posts to documents managed by a version control system allows me to:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Stick to my initial intention of having a working product at the end of each iteration.</li>
        <li>Use <a href="https://semver.org/" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">semantic versioning</a> and <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">git tags</a> for both the code and the docs that explain its desing choices, without the need of keeping a narrative or a discourse.</li>
        <li>Differentiate between what is considered a &ldquo;published&rdquo; version of code & docs (which will be both tagged <em>and</em> pushed to the remote repository) and work in progress that may be subject to change or even removal (which <em>won't</em> be tagged, and may not even be pushed to the remote repo).</li>
        <li>Forget about &ldquo;publishing&rdquo; at fixed dates. Things will be available to the public whenever they are pushed to remote. Simple as that.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>To allow the readers to track changes on design choices, I will keep a changelog with links to a <em>snippet,</em> a short doc explaining the rationale behind the change. For the sake of completeness, the changelog will track also every new feature implemented, and every bug fixed. The former will have a link to the document where the feature is explained; the latter just a short description of what has been fixed.</p>
