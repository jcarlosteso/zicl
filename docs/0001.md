# The adven*j*urer reloaded

In January 2023, I started a blog about porting [ZIL](https://www.ifwiki.org/ZIL) to [Clojure](https://clojure.org/). It's something I decided to do because it ties two of my favorite things: interactive fiction, and coding —what's more, coding in _Clojure_.

My initial intention for the blog was to capture every design decision in it, to make it more about the _why_ than about the _how_. That didn't last long, however. It became more of a _step-by-step guide to ZICL (Zork Implementation_ Clojure _Language)_.

Eventually, like I do with almost all of my personal projects —in case I even start them,— I abandoned the idea. There were [several reasons](meta/0001.md) for me to drop it. Some of them even were _real_ reasons. But the fact is, I cut the blog short, and I regret that.

So I'm going to try and reboot this. Not as a blog, but as an ongoing document which I'll keep on Github along with my code. There is a [reasoning](meta/0002.md) behind that change of format, too, but for now I'll just say I try to address some of the things that made me drop the previous iteration of this project.
